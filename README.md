# Weather forecast 
This desktop application is created in JavaFX. 
In this application it is possible to display the weather (temperature, wind speed, clouds, pressure sunrise and sunset, etc.) for any city. 
The application updates itself every hour or after clicking the refresh button. All data are downloaded from [Accuweather](https://www.accuweather.com).  
In the evening after 19:00, the background image for the night will change automatically.

Background image was created by Steven Telfer available on [page](https://dribbble.com/shots/5569453-Weather-App/attachments).
